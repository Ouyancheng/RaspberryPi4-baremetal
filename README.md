# RaspberryPi4-baremetal

There's an NES emulator that is supposed to work both on PC/Mac (with SDL2 library installed) and Raspberry Pi 4. 
However, on the main branch for some reason the Raspberry Pi 4 is not running it correctly (maybe it's clang's bug?)... 

If you want to see a demo of the emulator running on Raspberry Pi 4, please checkout branch rpi4working.
